<h3>Interstellar</h3>
</p>It's a sci-fi movie. It's thought-provoking, thrilling, makes you cry and makes you value time and life. </p> 
<h3>Inside-Out 2</h3>
</p>It's an animated movie but it's not just for kids. It normalizes feeling sad, anxious, huge amount of joy. </p> 
<h3>Lapata Ladies</h3>
</p>Set in India, it's a heartfelt and witty movie where 2 ladies accidently go with different men after their wedding in the darkness of the night and then the story progresses about how they eventually find each other in an era without proper phones and network.</p>
